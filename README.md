# SummonCraft Utils Plugin

## Description

This plugin is a collection of utilities for the SummonCraft plugin.  
**Please keep in mind** that this plugin is **proprietary** so you probably won't be able to use it.

I decided to make this plugin open source so that people can see how I did some things and maybe learn from it. 

I had a lot of fun developing plugins for the SummonCraft Network. Since this system was developed with one rule in mind: "_Feature releases as fast as possible_", I had to come up with some creative and dog shit solutions to make things work.

I hope you had as much fun on SummonCraft as I did.

Kind regards,
